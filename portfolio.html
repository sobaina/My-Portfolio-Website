            <h2 id="h2">About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm passionate about building systems that are reliable, scalable, and actually work in the real world. I
                enjoy solving problems that involve networking, distributed systems, and data structures especially when
                thereâ€™s some challenge to figure out.
                Lately, Iâ€™ve been working on building a peer-to-peer file-sharing system using consistent hashing,
                sockets, and multi-threading in Python. It handles faults, replicates files, and keeps things running
                even when nodes drop out a project that taught me a lot about system design and how all the moving parts
                need to work together.</p>

            <p>Iâ€™ve also worked with C++ and Python on different data structures and used MATLAB for algorithmic work in
                areas like bioinformatics !! I try to take a clear, methodical approach to whatever I build, whether
                it's
                for class, a side project, or something more experimental.</p>

            <p>Outside of code, Iâ€™m interested in how tech connects with other areas like art, ethics, and social
                impact. I
                believe good technology should be thoughtful, not just clever.></p>

            <p> Right now, Iâ€™m looking to connect with others who care about building smart, useful systems whether
                you're
                working on distributed computing, AI tools, or just cool projects that make peopleâ€™s lives easier. Letâ€™s
                reach out </p>

                <li>Social Media Manager (LUMS WOMEN IN COMPUTING - Society)
                    I managed official social media accounts to promote events and initiatives.
                    Developed and executed content strategies across social platforms (e.g., Instagram, Facebook) to
                    boost event awareness and student
                    participation. Leveraged analytics tools to track engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments) and
                    refined messaging for maximum impact.
                    Collaborated with event organizers and design teams to create cohesive promotional materials,
                    aligning campaigns with user interests and
                    society goal (2023-2024)</li>

                    Outreach Director (LUMS RELIGIOUS SOCIETY)
                    Led outreach initiatives to engage students and promote society events.
                    Coordinated with multiple departments and student groups for collaborations.
                    Organized and facilitated events that fostered community involvement.
                    <br>
                    Collected participant feedback after events and applied insights to improve future event planning
                    and user experience

                <li>
                    Random Trees Classifier in Python : Python, Decision Trees, Scikit-learn (for testing) Developed an
                    ensemble model using multiple randomized decision trees to improve classification
                    accuracy.
                </li>

                <li>
                    SVM Classifier from Scratch :
                    Python, NumPy, Scikit-learn (for benchmarking)
                    Implemented a binary Support Vector Machine classifier from
                    scratch without using ML libraries for training.
                    Applied the classifier on synthetic and real datasets, achieving
                    comparable accuracy to Scikit-learn's SVM
